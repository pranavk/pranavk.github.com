I am a passionate computer science student, currently pursuing a
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am interested in working with
latest technology, building applications, learning computer science
oriented stuff. I love tweaking with computers. I like to work on open
source projects, contribute to open source community in any way.

## About the Website

The website is made by using jekyll and some of the tweaking that I did with it. I love it. You can read my post about starting with jekyll in the blog archive if you are interested in creating such a website I have created, it takes no more than a day to fully
setup your jekyll website and once you are done, you'll fall in love with it
writing new posts everyday.
