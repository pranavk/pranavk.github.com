This year GUADEC was organized in the wonderful city of Gothenburg in Sweden. It
was my pleasure attending this conference for the second time, and meet several
awesome contributors in FOSS community again. Discussions with several contributors
helped me get a wonderful insight of various important topics in both GNOME,
as well as the LibreOffice project.

As a Summer of Code student this time
for LibreOffice, I also gave a talk about my (project)[http://pranavk.github.io/open-source/initial-preview-of-libreoffice-integration-with-gnome-documents/] with [Markus
Mohrhard](https://mmohrhard.wordpress.com/). You can download the slides
(here)[https://mmohrhard.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/integrating-libreoffice-with-gnome-documents.pdf].

I would like to thank whole of the GUADEC organizing team for organizing this event
smoothly. Last but not the least, a many thanks to TDF for sponsoring my travel
and accomodation without which all of this would not have been possible. I am
looking forward to have a long and exciting journey ahead with GNOME and Document Foundation.
