Working on interesting projects is always fun. Such kind of projects lures me
and drive myself to work harder. In addition, its always fun to work on projects
that has got an immense use case. Its always pleasing to see thousands of users
being benefitted from your work.

## Open source Developer at GNOME
I am open source contributor at GNOME Foundation. I also worked on a GSoC project for GNOME
titled [Browse DLNA Media Server Contents](https://wiki.gnome.org/ThreePointThirteen/Features/BrowseDMSPhotos).
With this project, I turned a GNOME application i.e gnome-photos
into a DLNA Media Player that can browse DLNA Media Servers on a local network.
I attended [GUADEC](http://guadec.org) 2014 in Strasbourg, France and met many expert hackers motivating more towards contributing to
open source community.

## Open source Developer at Mozilla
I am also a contributor at Mozilla Foundation. I have contributed few patches to Mozilla.

## Fedora
Have been doing package reviews lately.

I have worked on several projects, few of which included bleeding edge
technologies to manage and operate on data, sometimes big data too. Few of which
are Django, MongoDB, Redis, Ruby on Rails, GTK, Flask, OSRM.

## Distance API
This projects crunched data from [OpenStreetMaps](http://openstreetmaps.org) and provided API to potential 
customers and users to fetch Point of Interest near any city or any geographical coordinates. API was also able to
find distances between any two coordinates via road using [OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend) and time required
to reach from one point to another.
I used various softwares/frameworks like Django and Redis in this project. Playing with bleeding edge 
softwares like redis was fun.

## Fingerprint authentication platform
An rough online platform that would easily help next generation to login to systems more securely using their fingeprints.
I had to reverse engineer the bits from the device to get it working with Google Chrome extension using Wireshark.
I used [NBIS](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm) in this project and Flask to create RESTful API for fingerprint authentication.

Apart from that, there are other projects and repositories also that I contribute to which make use of other 
skills like ROR, GTK, MongoDB etc. You can have a look over
my [github profile](http://github.com/pranavk/).
