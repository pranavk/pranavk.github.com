I have been accepted at Google Summer of Code 2014 program. I am thankful to
Google. This is my first GSoC project and I am looking forward to give my best
shot. I am grateful to my mentor [Debarshi Ray](https://wiki.gnome.org/DebarshiRay) who 
has been very helping to me for my intial patches and first steps into GNOME community.

My project will incorporate a new feature in gnome-photos to support DLNA
Media Servers. After the completion of the project, gnome-photos application in
gnome would have this wonderful capability to browse all DLNA Media Servers
available on the local network. I am excited about working on this project 

Here is the [wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/2014/Projects/PranavKant_PhotosDLNA)
of the project.

I will be posting updates about the project on my
[blog](http://pranavk.github.io) under the tag `gnome-soc`.

I hope it will be a great summer ahead full of learning. I also wish other accepted
students good luck with their projects and a wonderful summer of code ahead.

Good Luck !
