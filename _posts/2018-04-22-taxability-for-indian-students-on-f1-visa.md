It's such a waste of time reading all the formalities you have to do
to comply with governments so that you end up paying your tax
correctly. And I like doing it very much.

Just for the background, I'm a Indian citizen going to US on a
student visa (F1). In this post, I am going to dump my research, some
interesting facts and
some unanswered questions.

First of all, all financial institutes including banks, MF houses, etc. follow
[FEMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Exchange_Management_Act). This
act, passed by Parliament of India in 1999, regulates the foreign
exchange related matters. It has its own definition that defines the
residency of Indian citizens. According to it, you are a resident
Indian if you have been in India for more than 182 days in the
*preceeding* financial year. There are some exception to the
rule. It doesn't include following people. If you are:
```
1) going for employement outside India, or
2) going for carrying on outside India a business or vocation, or
3) any other purpose that indicates your intention to stay outside
India for uncertain period.
```
RBI clarified it in its
[circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/SCRIPTs/BS_FemaNotifications.aspx?Id=2763)
that students going abroad come under point (3) above, since they stay
outside India for uncertain period. Quoting (4) from the RBI circular mentioned above:

```
4. Having regard to the circumstances stated above, it is clear that on both counts viz. their stay abroad for more than 182 days in the preceding financial year and their intention to stay outside India for an uncertain period when they go abroad for their studies, they can be treated as Non-Resident
```

This means you become a NRI right in the year you leave India for studies
abroad. Now it's illegal for NRIs to hold a resident saving accounts in
India. This means that a student like me, leaving in August for studies, will have to convert his
resident saving accounts in India to NRO accounts. I wish that was
easy but unfortunately not. When I asked my bank about it, they said
you need to close your existing account (that means all your FDs too)
and then open a new NRO account. How convenient! I know many people
don't convert their accounts to NRO account and no one cares at least
for the first time they are leaving India as a student.

This residency status doesn't just affect your bank accounts. It also
affects other financial institutions you have been dealing with for
your financial assets such as Mutual Funds houses. It's your duty to
inform all these houses of your residency status. Unfortunately, there
are [not many houses](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/mf/analysis/8-indian-mutual-fund-houses-that-allow-usa/canada-based-nris-to-invest/articleshow/56471762.cms) that allow investments from NRIs based in
US/Canada. Other houses would just refuse to deal with you if you are
an NRI. I am yet to find a solution to what I can do with my existing
MF investments in India while I am abroad. Can I just let them there?
Main reason I don't want to touch them is because majority of money is
in ELSS; if I break them before 3 years, I'll have to pay tax on it.

# Indian Taxability

Taxability has its own definition of residency. Here's the [official meaning](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/i-am/non-resident.aspx) by IT department for a
non-resident Indian. Let me rephrase what is written in these. You are resident in any
FY if:
```
1) You are in India for a total of 182 days or more, or
2) You are in India for total of atleast 60 days AND you were in India
for a total of 365 days or more within four years preceeding the
current FY.
```
Based on this definition, if I leave India on August 1, 2018, I will
be a non-resident according to IT dept. only for FY 19-20 while I will
be a resident for FY 18-19 (because I satisfy (2) above). Being a resident means that one is
supposed to report his global income(income arising in US) to India
while one is not under any obligation to do it when he's a
non-resident. This means if you are getting a stipend in US during
your studies, you pay the tax in US against it but you report it in
your Income tax return in India as well.

See how you are a resident according to IT department but non-resident
according to all banks and MFs (FEMA). What fun!

# US Taxability

First you need to [find out](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/determining-alien-tax-status) if you're a resident alient or nonresident
alien. To be a resident alien, you need to pass either [green card
test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/alien-residency-green-card-test)
or [substantial presence
test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test). Personally
for me, I fail the first test, but I pass the second test (substantial
presence test), if I leave to US on August 1, 2018. To pass this test,
you need to be physically present in US on atleast:
```
1) 31 days during current year AND
2) 183 days during the 3-year period counting days as:
2a) All days you were present in current year, plus,
2b) 1/3 days you were present in previous year, plus,
2c) 1/6 days you were present in previous to previous year.
```
For me, first condition is true but second is not. For second, my
calculation will be as:
```
152 days (1 August, 2018 - Dec 31, 2018)  + 0 + 0
```
So, I am in no way a resident alien. I must be a nonresident alien
then. This was easy but what about from next calendar year (from Jan
1, 2019). In that year, I will pass the above test. Does that mean I
will become a resident alien? The answer is "No" because students on F1 visa come under 'exempt individuals'. See
[this](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test)
where it says that you cannot count days as we counted above for the
days you are an exempt individual. This means that second condition in
'substantial presence test' above would be calculated as:
```
0 + 0 + 0
```
and not how I calculated above. Too many rules, huh, no?

As a nonresident alien, I am free from reporting my income earned in
MFs and other investments in India. This would have become a huge pain
had I been a resident alien because even unrealized gains are taxed in
US. As long as one is on F1 visa, they only have to report their
incomes generated in US (your stipend as TA/RA/GA or other jobs).

# Summary

So, ideally you should change the residency status to non-resident in your bank
accounts in India and inform all the MF houses to do the same
as well. Then you should file your IT return in India as a resident in your
first year you leave from India (means report your foreign income/stipend as
well; you don't have to pay tax on it as it's already paid in US - see
[double
taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_taxation)). From next
year (2019 in my case), you would have to report your unrealized gains
in all MFs in India in your US income tax return. This couldn't be
more fun, no? Feel free to post your views or correct me, if I was
wrong, in comments section.
