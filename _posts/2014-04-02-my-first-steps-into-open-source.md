I have been a huge fan of open source softwares for the last two and half
years. I have been using Linux during this whole time and have been trying to
explore more and more open source softwares available in the market. That means
that now to do any task, however complex, I try to find an open source
alternative to any existing easily available software like Adobe Photoshop. I
know using Photoshop but GIMP is even better.

Contributing to open source softwares is even more fun than using them. When you
see your code pushed to master and being used by thousands and sometimes
millions of users, you feel accomplished. Its been over a month that I have
started contributing to open source organisation including Mozilla and GNOME. I
have also applied for a GSoC 2014 project under [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/get-involved/) that proposes to extend
the [gnome-photos](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Photos) functionality by incorporating the support for [DLNA Media
Servers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance) in gnome-photos. The other contribution of mine being in [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org) was
also a wonderful experience. I learnt alot during the whole process of writing
the patch for Mozilla. The patch exposes the raw data functionality to UDP
Socket Messages interfaces. It was listed as a good-first-bug but I think the
patch complexity was good enough to not to list it as a good-first-bug.

Apart from that, I also started working on a standalone from scratch desktop
client for bugzilla viz. [bzdesk](https://www.gitorious.org/bzdesk) in C using GTK+. I will start working on it in
my free time since the project requires much of my time.

Working for above mentioned organisation was a wonderful experience. Both
Mozilla and GNOME are having excellent infrastructure, documentation and
community for newbie developers. #gnome-love channel on irc.gnome.org is very
helpful. They embrace the new developers trying to solve bugs for GNOME. Similar
is the case with Mozilla Community. The Mozilla Community is huge, you will find
variety of people working on various things. The architecture of Mozilla is also
complex as compared to GNOME. GNOME has easy to understand architecture. GNOME
has got variety of modules that provide a wonderful user experience.

It lures me to contribute to open source softwares. I am in love with GNOME
community and has plans to contribute to GNOME. The [GSoC 2014](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014) project under
GNOME if gets approved will be my first significant contribution to GNOME and
ultimately open source.
