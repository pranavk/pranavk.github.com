Working on interesting projects is always fun. Such kind of projects lures me
and drive myself to work harder. In addition, its always fun to work on projects
that has got an immense use case. Its always pleasing to see thousands of users
being benefitted from your work.

## Past work

I have worked on several projects, few of which included bleeding edge
technologies to manage and operate on data, sometimes big data too. Few of which
are Django, MongoDB, Redis, Ruby on Rails, GTK, Flask, OSRM.
