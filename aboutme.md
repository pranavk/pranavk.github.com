I am Pranav Kant studying Computer Science at **[National Institute of Technology Hamirpur](http://nith.ac.in)** and will be completing my undergraduate study in 2015. I love computers and like to tweak with computers just for fun.

I love coding and know Python, C, C++, JAVA, Ruby. Apart from computers, I also love to play football. Moreover I like browsing the internet, making new contacts, tweaking new softwares, getting aware of new technology.

I am a [Mozillian](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/pranavk) which means that I
have contributed few patches to Mozilla and an active
contributor to [GNOME](http://gnome.org) also. In GNOME, I mainly work on
gnome-photos.

My latest [GSoC 2014 project](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2014/pranav913/5757334940811264) is also an enhancement to gnome-photos.
